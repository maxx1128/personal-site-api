A little Sinatra app making a personalized API for my personal website data.

* My books: https://eleventy-site-api.herokuapp.com/books/
* A random quote from my collection of [quote maker](https://www.quotemaker.maxwellantonucci.com/) favorites: https://eleventy-site-api.herokuapp.com/quote/random/
  *  You can add a comma-separated string parameter of `orientations` with either "square," "portrait," or "landscape." So `square` or `square,landscape` would both work and return images that match.
